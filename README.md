# Raspberry PI 4 - Compute Module 4 openwrt image build with batteries included

Build a better out-of-the-box experience for Raspberry PI CM4 based routers 

### Contributing:

All contributions welcome!

### Motivation: 

Few months ago, I've configured [DFR0767-CM4](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2242.html) OpenWRT, with Docker, and lots of cool stuff (pihole and unifi manager) - which worked beautifully.

Unluckily few days I did a sysupgrade, which naturally reverted all of the installed packages. Including r8169 which is necessary to get my WAN interface up and running. 

Restoring things to previous config took me a few hours - again. Not to repeat this in few months, and maybe share it with others I've created this Repo.
